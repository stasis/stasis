  abstract =     "A number of recent studies have examined the
                 performance of concurrency control algorithms for
                 database management systems. The results reported to
                 date, rather than being definitive, have tended to be
                 contradictory. In this paper, rather than presenting
                 ``yet another algorithm performance study,'' we
                 critically investigate the assumptions made in the
                 models used in past studies and their implications. We
                 employ a fairly complete model of a database
                 environment for studying the relative performance of
                 three different approaches to the concurrency control
                 problem under a variety of modeling assumptions. The
                 three approaches studied represent different extremes
                 in how transaction conflicts are dealt with, and the
                 assumptions addressed pertain to the nature of the
                 database system's resources, how transaction restarts
                 are modeled, and the amount of information available to
                 the concurrency control algorithm about transactions'
                 reference strings. We show that differences in the
                 underlying assumptions explain the seemingly
                 contradictory performance results. We also address the
                 question of how realistic the various assumptions are
                 for actual database systems.",
