Title: Bulk Load Time - Single Transaction
Plot-Type: 2D Line
X-Label: Insertions
Y-Label: Seconds

### Example X-Range definitions.  
###
### Explicitly list each value that should be run:
### 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000
### X-Range: 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000
###
### List a range of values, incremented by 1:
### 1, 2, ... 10
### X-Range: 1..10
###
### List a range of values, then pass each value 
### into a perl expression:
### 100, 200 ... 1000

X-Range: 10, 100, 1000, 10000

### For each command, the first argument is the number of 
### transactions (fixed), while the second is the number 
### of operations per transaction.  $x will be replaced 
### accordingly.

Data-Series: Linear_Hash_NTA linearHashNTA 1 $x
Data-Series: Linear_Hash     logicalHash   1 $x
Data-Series: Berkeley_DB     bdbHash       1 $x

###
### These are passed into ci-parser.  They are both perl expressions, 
### and have access some predefied values. $time contains the $time 
### (raw Y value) returned by an invocation of a command.  @arg 
### contains the arguments passed into the command.
###
### The example below graphs time against the number of hashtable 
### operations (transactions * ops/transaction) in this running 
### example.
###

X-Calc: $arg[0] * $arg[1]
Y-Calc: $time

### Another way of presenting the data:
### time / operation:
#X-Calc: \$time / (\$arg[0] * \$arg[1])
### number of operations:
#Y-Calc: (\$arg[0](\$arg[1]))

### If true, then a graph will be produced even if some confidence
### intervals failed.

Force-Calc: 1
