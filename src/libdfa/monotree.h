/**
   Provides a binary tree that provides constant time insertion, but
   only accepts monotonically increasing values.  It's stored in an
   array, and periodically compacts itself with a little garbage
   collector.  Even though items must be inserted in sorted order, but
   can be removed in an arbitrary order.
  
   This data structure is hardcoded to operate on StateMachine
   structs, but could be easily generalized with a small performance
   hit.

   This library should be stable.

   TODO: If you pass NULL_STATE (ULONG_MAX) into any of these functions, the
   result is undefined.  This libary should check this instead of
   causing arbitrary memory corruption.
