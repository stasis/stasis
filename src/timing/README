README for timing suite:

Installation:

cd timing
gcc getTimeOfDay.c -o getTimeOfDay

# replace ~/bin with something in your path.

cp timer.pl getTimeOfDay ~/bin  

Finally, edit your copy of timer.pl to reflect the location of t-distribution.tbl on your system.

README for graphing suite:

Look in the timing-test-case for an example.  The .def file contains definitions that set the title, and x,y labels of the graph.  

The .dat files are the raw x,y data points (not all x's, y's need be present, or consistent between data sets).

It should work for an arbitrary number of .dat files.


To use the .ps file, you'll have to do this when you compile your latex:

latex bar.tex
dvips -j0 bar.dvi
ps2pdf bar.ps
