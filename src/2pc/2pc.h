/** To use this library, you need to implement:

<ul>
<li> get_broadcast_group, which maps from message to broadcast group.
<li> prepare_or_veto_2pc, which, given a message, returns SUBORDINATE_VETO_2PC or SUBORDINATE_PREPARED_2PC, and calls abort, if appropriate
<li> abort, which handles the application specific actions for abort
<li> commit, which handles the application specific commit.
</ul>

A note on transaction ID's: clients specify transaction ID's by
addressing messages to the state machine with machine_id =
transaction_id.  

The coordinator sends an ack to the client once the transaction
commits or aborts, and keeps the machine around until the client ack's
the ack.  This is done in order to provide exactly once semantics.  

No locking, or ordering of requests is performed by the library.

The 64-bit transaction id's could, in principle, be reused.  

Distinct requests with identical transaction id's are serialized by
the current implementation, but no scheduling is done.  The first
request that retries after a transaction completes is the one that
gets to reuse the transaction id.

@todo Users of 2pc should not have to deal with dfaSets, so they shouldn't
      be passed into the callbacks.  Instead, only pass in the app-specific 
      payload.

    The callbacks are called whenever the transition 'should' succeed.
    Other than tally_2pc, they are always called when a
    corresponding message comes in.  tally_2pc is only called after
    the last subordinate votes to prepare.

    All callbacks (other than veto_or_prepare) should return TRUE or
    FALSE, depending on whether or not the transition should
    succeed. veto_or_prepare returns SUBORDINATE_PREPARED_2PC,
    SUBORDINATE_VETO_2PC, or OVERRIDDEN_STATE.

    Under normal operations, they should never return OVERRIDDEN_STATE
    or FALSE, since that would violate the normal 2pc protocol.
