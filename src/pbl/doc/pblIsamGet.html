get the key and keylen of a record

<P>parameter which specifies which record to get relative
to the search key specified by index.
the following values for which are possible

<P><BR><B> PBLTHIS  </B> - get key and keylen of current record
<BR><B> PBLNEXT  </B> - get key and keylen of next record
<BR><B> PBLPREV  </B> - get key and keylen of previous record
<BR><B> PBLFIRST </B> - get key and keylen of first record
<BR><B> PBLLAST  </B> - get key and keylen of last record

<P>parameter index specifies which of the keys to get,
the pseudo index value -1 can be used in order to access the file
sequentially in the order the records were inserted.
okey is not set in this case, a keylength of 0 is returned in case
the call went ok.

<P><P>
<B>RESTRICTIONS</B>:
<BR> - the out parameter okey must point to a memory area that is
big enough to hold any possible key, i.e 255 bytes
