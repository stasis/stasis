find a record in an ISAM file, set the current record

<P>parameter which specifies which record to find relative
to the search key specified by skey and skeylen.
the following values for which are possible

<P><BR><B> PBLEQ </B> - find a record whose key is equal to skey
<BR><B> PBLFI </B> - find the first record that is equal
<BR><B> PBLLA </B> - find the last record that is equal
<BR><B> PBLGE </B> - find the last record that is equal or the smallest
record that is greater
<BR><B> PBLGT </B> - find the smallest record that is greater
<BR><B> PBLLE </B> - find the first record that is equal or the biggest
record that is smaller
<BR><B> PBLLT </B> - find the biggest record that is smaller

<P>parameter index specifies which of the keys to use

<P><P>
<B>RESTRICTIONS</B>:
<BR> - the out parameter okey must point to a memory area that is
big enough to hold any possible key, i.e 255 bytes
