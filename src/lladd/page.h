 * @file
 *
 * interface for dealing with slotted pages
 *
 * This file provides a re-entrant interface for pages that contain
 * variable-size records.
 *
 * @ingroup LLADD_CORE
 * $Id$
 * 
 * @todo The slotted pages implementation, and the rest of the page
 * structure should be seperated, and each page should have a 'type'
 * slot so that we can implement multiple page types on top of LLADD.

      Each page has an associated read/write lock.  This lock only
      protects the internal layout of the page, and the members of the
      page struct.  Here is how rwlatch is held in various circumstances:
      
      Record allocation:  Write lock
      Record read:        Read lock
      Read LSN            Read lock
      Record write       *READ LOCK*
      Write LSN           Write lock
      Write page to disk  No lock
      Read page from disk No lock

      Any circumstance where one these locks are held during an I/O
      operation is a bug.  
      
      For the 'no lock' cases, @see loadlatch

  */
  
  rwl * rwlatch;

  /**
      Since the bufferManager re-uses page structs, this lock is used
      to ensure that the page is in one of two consistent states,
      depending on whether a read lock or a write lock is being held.
      If a read lock is held, then the page is managed by the rwlatch
      also defined in this struct.  Therefore, it cannot be read from
      or written to disk.  Furthermore, since we do not impose an
      order on operations, the holder of a readlock may not use the
      lsn field to determine whether a particular operation has
      completed on the page.

      The write lock is used to block all writers (other than the one
      holding the page), and to ensure that all updates with lsn less
      than or equal to the page's lsn have been applied.  Therefore,
      threads that write the page to disk must hold this lock.  Since
      it precludes access by all other threads, a write lock also
      allows the holder to evict the current page, and replace it.

      Examples:
      
      Write page to disk    Write lock
      Read page from disk   Write lock
      Allocate a new record Read lock
      Write to a record     Read lock
      Read from a record    Read lock
