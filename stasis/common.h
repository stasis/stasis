 * A standard header file, adopted from Autobook. 
 *
 * http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/
 *
 * The idea behind this file is twofold.  First, we want to keep as
 * much of the \#ifdef portability nonsense in here as possible.
 * Second, we allow users to \#include headers that in turn \#include
 * common.h.  If they do so, then their code should continue to 'do
 * the right thing' and build, even though they do not \#include the
 * config.h file that all of the Stasis stuff uses.
 *
 * @todo Need to make sure every .c file actually includes this thing, and
 * also includes constants.h
