/**
 * @file
 * Manages the page buffer

    bufferManager - Provides cached page handling, delegates to blob
    manager when necessary.  Doesn't implement an eviction policy.
    That is left to a cacheManager.  (Multiple cacheManagers could be
    used with a single bufferManager.)

  @todo Allow error checking!  
 
  @todo Refactoring for lock manager
 
  Possible interface for lockManager:

       Define three classes of objects that the lock manager is interested in:

         Transactions,
	 Operations,
	 Predicates.

       Stasis already has operations and transactions, and these can be
       relatively unchanged.  Predicates are read only operations that
       return a set of tuples.  Tread() is the simplest predicate.
       Index scans provide a motivating example.  

       See http://research.microsoft.com/%7Eadya/pubs/icde00.pdf
       (Generalized Isolation Level Definitions, Adya, Liskov, O'Neil,
       2000) for a theoretical discussion of general locking schemes..

       Locking functions can return errors such as DEADLOCK, etc.
       When such a value is returned, the transaction aborts, and an
       error is passed up to the application.
