/**
 * @file
 * 
 * New version of logstreamer; designed to work with logEntry, and has
 * a simplified API.
 *
 * logstreamer is the implementation of writing the log tail
 * It must be bufferred -- in that when something is written to the log tail it
 * is not immediately written to disk, but rather just to memory. But
 * logstreamer must be able to force flush to disk, which will be done when a
 * commit log entry is written to the log tail
 * 
 * Note: using the stdio FILEs for this, and by default it is "fully" buffered.
 * The log tail may be flushed to disk without an explicit call to fflush (when
 * the program terminates, the file closes), but this is acceptable because it
 * never hurts to have more flushes to disk, as long as it doesn't hurt
 * performance.
 *
 * @todo Everything in this file cores on failure (no error handling yet)
 * @todo logWriter is optimized for forward operation, scanning backwards 
 *       (as in abort()) is very slow.  Perhaps we should maintian a 
 *       'write behind' buffer?
 *

   Next, the contents of the log, starting with the LSN passed into
   this function are copied to logfile.txt~

   Finally, logfile.txt~ is moved on top of logfile.txt

   As long as the move system call is atomic, this function should
   maintain the system's durability.

   The multithreaded case is a bit more complicated, as we need
   to deal with latching:

   With no lock, copy the log.  Upon completion, if the log has grown,
   then copy the part that remains.  Next, obtain a read/write latch
   on the logfile, and copy any remaining portions of the log.
   Perform the move, and release the latch.
