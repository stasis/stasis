   @file 

   Interface for I/O handle implementations.

   This interface is designed to provide some extra features needed by
   the buffer manager and the log, and to hide the operating system's
   I/O interface from the rest of Stasis.

   Handles are composable, and some features, such as log truncation,
   non-blocking writes are not implemented by all file handle
   implementations, and are instead supported by wrapping a file
   handle that performs raw I/O with one that adds extra
   functionality.

   This file describes the minimum concurrency guarantees provided by
   handle implementations.  See the handle implementations'
   documentation for more information about concurrency.

   Each handle defines two sets of methods that read, write and append
   to the file.  The first set (read(), write() and append()) take a
   buffer that is allocated by the caller.  The second set
   (read_buffer(), write_buffer() and append_buffer()) use memory that
   is managed by the handle.  Callers must explicitly release these
   buffers by calling release_read_buffer() or release_write_buffer().

   Finally, handles support truncation from the <i>beginning</i> of
   the file, which is needed by the log manager.  The off parameters
   passed into functions are relative to the original start of the
   file.  Negative file offsets are reserved for
   implementation-specific purposes.



   Error handling:

   read, write, append, open, release_read_buffer and
   release_write_buffer return 0 on success, and an error code
   otherwise.  read_buffer() and write_buffer() return error codes via
   the error field of the handles they produce.

   An error that occurs while writing to the handle leaves the region
   that was being written in an undefined state.

   Errors in num_copies, num_copies_buffer, start_position, and end_position
   are always unrecoverable, and return -1.

   close returns 0 on success, or an error code otherwise.  close
   always frees the handle that was passed into it, regardless of
   whether an error occurred.

   Here are the meanings of the various error codes:

   EDOM   off is less than the beginning of the file (possibly due to
          truncation).

   EBADF  an unrecoverable error occurred; the handle is no longer vaild.  The
          error that caused this one is stored in the handle's error field.

   Handle implementations may return return other errors as appropriate.


   @todo rename *_buffer() functions to get_*_buffer()

                          one of the slow handles (this is useful when
                          slow_factory returns a singleton handle...).

   @param fast_factory A callback function that returns a handle with
                       a given offest and length.  The handle need not
                       support persistant storage, and is used as
                       write buffer space.  Typically, fast handles
                       will be allocated out of a pool.

   @param fast_factory_arg A pointer to data that will be passed into
                           fast_factory.
