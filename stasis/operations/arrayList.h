   @ingroup ARRAY_LIST

   @defgroup ARRAY_LIST ArrayList

   O(1) growable array.

   ArrayList provides an growable array of fixed length records with
   O(1) complexity for all operations.  The list grows by doubling the
   amount of space it reserves each time the list is extended.
   Therefore, this data structure can use up to twice as much storage
   as is strictly necessary.

   These arrays are similar to those in Java's ArrayList class.
   Essentially, the base page contains a fixed size array of recordid's
   pointing at contiguous blocks of pages.  Each block is twice as big
   as the previous block.

   The base block is of type FIXED_PAGE, of int values. The first few slots
   are reserved and store information about the arrayList (size of
   array entries, number/size of allocated regions, etc.)

   @todo arrayList's base block should store pageid_t values, not ints.
