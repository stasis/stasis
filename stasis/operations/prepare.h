/**
 * @file 
 *
 * Prepare a transaction to commit so that it will persist
 * across system crashes.  After recovery, the transaction will be in 
 * the same state it was in when Tprepare() was called.
 *
 * Tprepare() uses the operation interface to abstract away log handling.
 * It would be nice if the logger API could be simplified by having
 * more of its functionality handled this way.
 *
 Implementation notes:
 
 - Just a Tupdate, with a log flush as its operationsTable[]
 function.
 
 - After recovery, all of the xacts pages will have been 'stolen',
 (if recovery flushes dirty pages)
 
 - Recovery function needs to distinguish between actions before and
 after the last Tprepare log entry.  This is handle by a guard on
 the logHandle's iterator, but could be generalized in the future
 (to support savepoints, for example) Right now, recovery uses a
 guarded iterator, transUndo() does not.
