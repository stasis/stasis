Stasis is an experimental flexible transactional storage library.

Please see the COPYING file for licensing information.  

More information about installation, a tutorial and API documentation
are available at:

http://lladd.sourceforge.net/developers/html/

First, make sure you have the appropriate dependencies:

'make check' requires the GNU check library, 'make doc' requires Doxygen.

You'll need Berkeley DB to build; it isn't actually used by Stasis, but 
I haven't gotten around to making it optional.

You also need libconfuse; it is used by some of the programs that ship 
with Stasis.


To build, do:

./reconf

or 

./reconf-1.8

You'll need to have a version of automake >= 1.7 for ./reconf to work,
or have automake 1.8 for ./reconf-1.8 to work.  Different packages of
automake should be able to coexist on the same system, and probably
ship with your distribution.

./configure
make
make check
make install

To build the API and internals documentation, run:

make docs

after configure.

We don't support "make install". ;)

The unit test logs for lcov describe how the coverage report was 
generated.
