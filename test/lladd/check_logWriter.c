/**
   @test 

   Quick test of log writer and log handler.  Not very extensive.
   Just writes out 3000 log entries, checks that 1000 of them make
   sense, and then closes, opens and iterates over the resulting log
   file to make sure that it contains 3000 entries, and none of its
   builtin assertions fail.

   In particular, logWriter checks to make sure that each log entry's
   size matches the size that it recorded before the logEntry.  Also,
   when checking the 1000 of 3000 entries, this test uses
   readLSNEntry, which tests the logWriter's ability to succesfully
   manipulate LSN's.

   @todo Test logHandle more thoroughly. (Still need to test the guard mechanism.)
